How I Used AI This Week

This week, I used AI in a few different ways to support both my coursework and career preparation.

Clarifying Assignment Instructions
I used ChatGPT to help me better understand parts of my assignments that were unclear or confusing. For example, I asked for help interpreting what was required in my metadata project and Python notebook. The AI broke down each section step by step, which made it easier for me to know what to include and how to structure my answers.

Internship Searching
I also used AI to explore potential internships for Winter 2025 and Summer 2026. It helped me identify cybersecurity-related positions that matched my interests and skills. The AI also gave me advice on what keywords to use when searching online and how to approach recruiters professionally.

Reflection

AI has been a helpful tool this week, especially for clarifying assignment expectations and improving my professional materials. It’s made my workflow smoother by helping me interpret confusing instructions and by giving me personalized feedback on my internship applications and resume. I’m learning to use it more strategically — not just for quick answers, but as a way to get clear explanations and improve the quality of my work.
