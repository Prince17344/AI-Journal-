How I Used AI This Week

This week, I used AI in a few different ways to support both my coursework and career preparation.

Clarifying Assignment Instructions
I used ChatGPT to help me better understand parts of my assignments that were unclear or confusing. For example, I asked for help interpreting what was required in my metadata project and Python notebook. The AI broke down each section step by step, which made it easier for me to know what to include and how to structure my answers.

Internship Searching
I also used AI to explore potential internships for Winter 2025 and Summer 2026. It helped me identify cybersecurity-related positions that matched my interests and skills. The AI also gave me advice on what keywords to use when searching online and how to approach recruiters professionally.

Reflection

AI has been a helpful tool this week, especially for clarifying assignment expectations and improving my professional materials. It’s made my workflow smoother by helping me interpret confusing instructions and by giving me personalized feedback on my internship applications and resume. I’m learning to use it more strategically — not just for quick answers, but as a way to get clear explanations and improve the quality of my work.



AI Journal Entry – Week of November 16, 2025

This week I used AI mainly to help me stay on track with my database lab and understand the steps more clearly. Some of the instructions for building the Pet Adoption Status ERD were confusing at first, especially the parts about forward engineering and importing the tables in the correct order. I asked ChatGPT to walk me through the process, and it helped me understand every st`ep — creating the tables, setting up the primary and foreign keys, and exporting the final SQL script.

And similar to last week I also used AI when I wasn’t sure about some of my assignment responses. Instead of just giving me the correct answer, AI explained why my original answers weren’t correct and what I misunderstood. This helped me fix my mistakes myself and actually understand the reasoning, which felt more useful than just being told the right choice.

Outside of class, I continued using AI for internship preparation. I asked for help improving my resume again, focusing on cybersecurity roles and refining my bullet points so they fit those positions better. And overall, AI has been a consistent support tool this week. It helped clear up confusion in my lab work, taught me how to correct my own mistakes, and kept me moving forward with internship preparation. I’m starting to use it more like a tutor and a guide instead of just a shortcut, which is helping me stay organized and build more confidence in my work
